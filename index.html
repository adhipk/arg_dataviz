                    <i>The Problem with Jon Stewart</i> Season 2 Episode 2 titled "Where is Our Tax
                    Money Going?" focuses on the subject of taxes in America. During the introduction,
                    they discuss a surprising statistic, the United States
                    ranks #35 on Average Income Tax Burden. They claimed that
                    Americans paid an average of 8% of household income in
                    taxes, compared to Swedes (ranked #5) who pay an average of
                    38%.

                <p>Data Source: <a href = "https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?QueryId=55129">OECD Database</a></p>

                    <h3>
                        <i> "The point is it's low. Lower than you'd think." </i>– Yes, the US tax rate is low.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        This data is sourced to the OECD, checking their database we
                        see that this data comes from the "Average Tax Wedge"
                        dataset for the year 2021, for "One-Earner Married Couple
                        with Two Children".

                    </div>

                        This data is conclusive, Countries like Sweden and Finland
                        pay significantly higher taxes so they have better public services,
                        leading to higher approval for these taxes. Conversely, US citizens paying a measly 8% can't expect high quality public healthcare, schools, etc. — You only get what you pay for.

                    <h3>
                        <i>
                            "Eight percent is the average tax burden in the United
                            States of America? That can't be right." 
                        </i>
                        –  No, the US tax rate isn't <i>that </i>low.
                    </h3>
    
                    <p>
                        It should be noted that the data presented in the video
                        only looks at the year 2021, which was an atypical year
                        by any standard. With the COVID-19 pandemic and the
                        resulting economic downturn, the US government took several
                        steps to ease the financial burden, including issuing tax waivers and stimulus packages <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-offers-overview-of-tax-provisions-in-american-rescue-plan-retroactive-tax-benefits-help-many-people-now-preparing-2020-returns">[1]</a>. These measures were funded by taxpayer dollars, effectively lowering the
                        tax rate. Let's look at the data for 2022 instead.

    
                    <div class="svg-container">
                        <svg id="against-chart"></svg>
                    </div>
                        The 2022 data tells a slightly different story. The average tax rate is now 20%. The US still ranks lower than countries like Sweden and Finland, but it's not far off from the countries like Canada (22%) or the UK (25%). Countries that have robust public services as the interviews in the video later show.
                        The problem isn't that the US is getting the services it pays for, the problem is that it isn't.
